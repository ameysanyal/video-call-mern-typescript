# This configuration tells Nginx:

# root: The root of the web server is /usr/share/nginx/html.

# index: The default file to serve is index.html.

# location /: This is the most important part for SPAs. The try_files directive tells Nginx to:

# Try to serve the requested URI ($uri).

# If that fails, try to serve the URI as a directory ($uri/).

# If both of those fail, serve index.html. This ensures that all routes are handled by your React app, preventing a 404.
